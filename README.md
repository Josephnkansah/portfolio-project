What is a Portfolio Project?
The Portfolio Project is a capstone endeavor designed to encapsulate all the skills and knowledge you’ve acquired during the ALX Foundations program. You will be tasked with creating a project from scratch, showcasing your ability to apply what you’ve learned in a real-world context.

Freedom to Explore
We’re setting you free on this one. There are no strict guidelines on what to build. Your heart’s desire, guided by your creative spirit, is the limit. Mobile apps, web applications, game development—pick your passion and run with it.

Project Structure Overview
Your Portfolio Project will unfold in three distinct stages, each with its own set of objectives and deliverables.

1. Research Phase
Duration: 3 weeks, comprising 3 mini-projects.

Idea Generation: Begin with brainstorming and documenting your project idea.
MVP Design: Develop a concept for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Project Planning: Draft a detailed plan on how you’ll execute the projects.
2. Building Phase
Duration: 3 weeks, also with 3 projects.

Development: This is where your project starts to take shape. Begin with the MVP and expand from there.
Landing Page Creation: Develop a compelling landing page for your project.
Presentation Preparation: Start preparing for your project presentation.
3. Post-Project Phase
Duration: 1-2 weeks

Blog Post: Write about your experience and what you learned during the project development process.
GitHub Clean-up: Refine your project’s GitHub repository, focusing on improving the README and documentation.
Final Presentations: If you haven’t presented your project yet, now is the time.

What’s this “Research & project approval”?
Before starting any coding, you will need to research and define your portfolio project over the course of 3 weeks. In the first week, the Project Proposal will be approved, followed by the second week where the MVP will be defined, and finally presented as a collection of tasks on a Trello board.

This first part is focused on creating a Project Proposal and requires that a google Document is submitted for Manual Review by a technical staff member. Please take time to brainstorm, research, and explore what currently exists during this first phase.
